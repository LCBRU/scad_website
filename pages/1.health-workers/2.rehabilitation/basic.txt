The definition for Cardiac Rehabilitation has been taken from the British Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (BACPR); it represents their combined key elements:

> “The coordinated sum of activities required to influence favourably the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, as well as to provide the best possible physical, mental and social conditions, so that the patients may, by their own efforts, preserve or resume optimal functioning in their community and through improved health behaviour, slow or reverse progression of disease”.

Cardiac rehabilitation improves functional capacity and perceived quality of life whilst also supporting early return to work and the development of self-management skills [1]. This makes cardiac rehabilitation one of the most clinically and cost-effective therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular disease management [2-6].
