text_main: SCAD is caused by small tears inside an artery which allows blood to escape into the outer layers of the artery. It is unclear at the moment what the specific cause of this condition is. We are currently researching SCAD to find out more, if you would like to get involved, [click here](https://scad.lcbru.le.ac.uk/content/get-involved).

SCAD can affect all age groups and sexes. However, it predominantly affects women and can sometimes occur in association with pregnancy. 

So far we have not generally found SCAD to run in families so there is no reason to fear that your own children will be affected.
