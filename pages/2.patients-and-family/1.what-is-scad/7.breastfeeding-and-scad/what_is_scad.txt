text_main: Some patients have SCAD in the first few months after a pregnancy, when they may still be breastfeeding. Sometimes health status and other practical issues mean that breastfeeding cannot be continued, but it is also important to check the safety of medication whilst breastfeeding. 

Advice on the safety of drugs during breastfeeding can be obtained [here](https://www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk/detailed-information/drugs-in-breastmilk/); patients as well as health care professionals are able to use this service.
