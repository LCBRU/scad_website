[Dr Al-Hussaini and Dr Adlam](/about-us/meet-the-team) have recently written a [review article](http://heart.bmj.com/content/heartjnl/early/2017/03/31/heartjnl-2016-310320.full.pdf) which summarises the current state of knowledge about SCAD. Unfortunately copyright issues mean we cannot post the full article here.

The research team have written an [editorial](https://www.pcronline.com/eurointervention/127th_issue/volume-13/number-12/220/editorial-on-characteristics-of-extension-and-de-novo-recurrent-spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection.html?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=171208-EIJETOC&utm_content=171208-EIJETOC+CID_449db5161921ccaa4a901b39245465e0&utm_source=email&utm_term=Editorial%20on%20Characteristics%20of%20extension%20and%20de%20novo%20recurrent%20spontaneous%20coronary%20artery%20dissection) commenting on an article about SCAD recurrence and extension.

Analysis of recently acquired research data is in progress and will be published on this website as soon as the articles are available. Topics studied include the genetics of SCAD, the relationship with fibromuscular dysplasia, vascular responses in patients in SCAD as well as the value of different imaging modalities post SCAD. We are also collaborating with other centres overseas on topics including pregnancy related SCAD.
