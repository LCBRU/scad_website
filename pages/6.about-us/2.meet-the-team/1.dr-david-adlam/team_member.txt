Dr Dave Adlam is an academic cardiologist working in Leicester in the UK. Working with SCAD-survivors he established SCAD UK/EU with the three aims of: furthering research into SCAD; supporting survivors of SCAD and enhancing knowledge of SCAD amongst health care professionals and the public. In particular his focus is on fostering collaborative research to try to get answers for SCAD patients by working with interested researchers and doctors throughout the world. Outside medicine he tries unsuccessfully to keep up with his two daughters. He thinks he is a ‘cool Dad’ (the views of his daughters cannot be shared here).
