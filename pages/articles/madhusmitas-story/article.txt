text_main: It was a normal workday on 7 September 2017. I was sitting at my desk working when I felt a sudden pain in my chest. Thinking it to be a muscle pull, I tried to ease it out by going out for a walk.

I only managed to get out of the door before the pain starting growing towards my arms, jaws and back. Not wanting to create a fuss at work called a colleague quietly out of the room as the pain was getting unbearable now and I was tears.

She escorted me to the A&E department (luckily I work at a hospital). After ECG, X â€“ray and two rounds of blood test the doctor came back and said all of my bloods came normal except troponin levels, which were very high, indicating what I had was a minor heart attack.

My world came crashing down as it had been four hours since the pain, but I was still waiting at A&E, thinking soon it will be time to pick up my little girl from school. (She had only started reception 2 days before!) I only called up my husband when they said I was not going home today, but getting admitted instead.

I spent the next five days in hospital on constant heart monitor and an angio revealed that it was a SCAD. It was such a big shock to me especially when I was a non-smoker, non-drinker, very active, only 33 years of age and fit as a fiddle until that day. My doctor said it was a rare condition, There was no way to prevent or predict it and I was just unlucky.
