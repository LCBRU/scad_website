**SCAD** is the abbreviation for **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection**. It is a rare condition that occurs when there is a tear in the wall of an artery supplying the heart. This can lead to a heart attack, as the blood supply to the heart is interrupted. The name SCAD can be broken down as follows:

- **Spontaneous**: there is no injury, apparent disease or other direct cause for the dissection of the coronary artery, it appears to "just happen".
- **Coronary**: dissections can happen in other parts of the body, but when it happens in a blood vessel supplying the heart muscle tissue, it can cause a heart attack.
- **Artery**: Arteries supply blood (carrying oxygen) to a muscle or organ of the body, veins carry the blood back to the heart.
- **Dissection**: the technical term for separation of the layers of the blood vessel wall

SCAD can present in different ways:

In some cases there is a visible **dissection flap** with a communication between the part of the artery supplying blood to the heart, and the split in the wall. In other cases this communication is not seen but there is an **intramural haematoma**, where the artery wall is damaged and a collection of blood leaks into the tissue. This causes a swelling which blocks the blood flow.
