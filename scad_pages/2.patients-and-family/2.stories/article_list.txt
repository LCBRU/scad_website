text_main: SCAD is a rare disease and survivor's might find themselves confused and without support. **BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE!**

![](survivors-2015.png)

These personal stories from SCAD survivors will help you to make sense of what you have been through, and gain an understanding of the treatment and recovery process. You can gain a sense of what life is like after SCAD, from people who have been through a similar experience to your own. 

But please remember that, as these stories demonstrate, no two people have exactly the same experiences...

We are now looking for updates to the stories we have here, to provide an insight into what the future holds for SCAD survivors. 

If you would like to share your story, please email <scad@uhl-tr.nhs.uk>
