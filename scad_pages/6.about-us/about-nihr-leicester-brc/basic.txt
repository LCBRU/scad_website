text: ## The Leicester Biomedical Research Centre (LBRC)

The Cardiovascular Theme of the Leicester Biomedical Research Centre (LBRC) at [Glenfield Hospital](https://www.leicestershospitals.nhs.uk/aboutus/our-hospitals/glenfield-hospital/) aims to improve the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of coronary heart disease and hypertension (high blood pressure). The unit provides state-of-the-art facilities, equipment and staff to assist researchers in their complex projects. The LBRC is one of 20 units around England funded by the [National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/), a strategic research funding body within the NHS. The LBRC is a partnership between the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/) and the [University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust](https://www.leicestershospitals.nhs.uk/).

The LBRC leads on groundbreaking new research that will have a direct impact upon patient care.  Joining us in the work of the LBRC, you will help pave the way to improve care for patients with coronary artery and cardiovascular disease.

The improvements will be in areas such as:

1. Finding genes that put you at risk of heart illnesses
2. Developing new tests to diagnose heart illnesses
3. Using tests to help doctors and nurses decide how best to treat patients with heart illnesses
4. Finding new ways to assess how severe a heart illness is likely to become
