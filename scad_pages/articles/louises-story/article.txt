text_main: At the age of 37 I had 2 episodes of a heart-burn pain which travelled down my left arm and the second of these was while I prepared to go to an aerobics class. I felt a fluttering under my rib cage, and fear led me to phone 999.

I was taken by ambulance to hospital where a blood test revealed a problem, possibly a blood clot on my lung and I was told I would have to stay in. As soon as I was told this, the pain returned but this time far worse, with pain in both my arms, my chest, neck and head. Doctors looked on bemused as I was young and healthy and **they told me it was stress** I was feeling!

I was moved to Medical Assessment where I was sick, and looking back I now see how many **classic heart attack symptoms** I had! It was almost 24 hours before I was told it was a heart attack and moved swiftly to Coronary Care. Two days later I had an angiogram which showed a long tear in my Circumflex artery and I was later told it was Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD).

It was only when I was back at home that the shock hit me. You see, **it wasn't just physical weakness I felt, I was an emotional wreck** and fearful when I lay down to sleep, monitoring my heart beat, as if it could stop at any moment. I needed answers and I still do and this is why I am so keen to be involved in research.

Just 2 months after this, while regaining my confidence at Cardiac Rehabilitation classes, I developed a pain in my abdomen. After suffering excruciating pain for days I was found to have an enlarged ovary which needed to be removed. I had to wait until doctors considered my heart to be strong enough to cope with major surgery so my operation was 4 months after SCAD. Did the ovary problem cause my SCAD? I would love to know.

I tell my story wherever I can, which helps me to cope, but I still feel the effects of SCAD. Not only am I now a more anxious person, but SCAD has removed my hope of having a baby. Every time I hear of a new case I cry. I don't want anyone else to suffer the fear and sadness that SCAD brings.

**SCAD research brings so much hope** that we may soon know why it happens. We want quicker SCAD diagnosis, and medical treatment which is appropriate to this condition.
